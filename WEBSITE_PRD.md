## 6. Recommended Technology Stack

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Recommended Stack: React + Vite + TailwindCSS**
> This stack is optimized for modern, interactive promotional sites with a rich ecosystem and excellent developer experience.

### 6.1 Primary Recommendation: React + Vite

| Layer | Technology | Rationale |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| **Framework** | [React](https://react.dev) | Industry standard, vast ecosystem, component-based |
| **Build Tool** | [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) | Extremely fast dev server and HMR |
| **Styling** | TailwindCSS v4 | Utility-first, fast development, consistent design |
| **Animation** | Framer Motion | Powerful, declarative animations for React |
| **Icons** | Lucide React | Clean, consistent SVG icons as components |
| **Routing** | React Router | Standard routing solution for SPAs |
| **Deployment** | Vercel / Netlify | Optimized for frontend frameworks |
| **Analytics** | Plausible or GA4 | Privacy-respecting options |

#### Why React + Vite?
- **Rich Interaction** – Easier to implement complex animations and state management
- **Ecosystem** – Access to massive library of components and tools
- **Performance** – Vite ensures lightning fast development and optimized production builds
- **Maintainability** – Component-based architecture scales well
- **Modern Standards** – Uses latest ES modules and features

### 6.2 Alternative Options

| Stack | Best For | Trade-offs |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **Next.js (Static Export)** | If future blog/CMS needed | Heavier, more complex |
| **Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS** | Maximum simplicity | Manual optimization required |
| **Hugo/Eleventy** | Pure static sites | Less component-friendly |
| **SvelteKit** | If reactive features needed | Overkill for marketing site |

**Netlify-Specific SEO Settings:**
```toml
# netlify.toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "dist"

[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    X-Frame-Options = "DENY"
    X-Content-Type-Options = "nosniff"
    Referrer-Policy = "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
```

### 12.4 Future Migration to Custom Domain
When ready to upgrade:
